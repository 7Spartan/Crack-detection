# Real time and post processing crack detection software.
• The software is used to detect cracks on concrete surfaces.
• Pre-processed a dataset of 52000 images.
• Used VGG-16 model for crack detection with an accuracy of 90%.
• Generated heatmap and bounding box over the detected crack using machine vision algorithms.

Programming Language Used - Python.
Tools Used - PyQt, Jupyter Notebook, OpenCV, Deep Learning, Keras
